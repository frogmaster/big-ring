    <h2>introduction</h2>

    <h2>Download</h2>
    <p>
    Please download the application from the <a href="download.html">Download page</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Installing</h2>

    <p>Big Ring does not have to be installed. Simply extract the files from the zip-file
    you downloaded. Right-click on the zip-file and choose "Extract files". The
    resulting folder will contain all files needed for running Big Ring.</p>

    <h2>ANT+ USB Stick on Windows</h2>

    <p>To use Big Ring with ANT+ sensors, you will need to use an ANT+ USB stick
    (e.g. <a href="http://www.thisisant.com/developer/components/antusb2">this one</a>.).
    If you do not have an ANT+ stick, you can still run the program, but will be
    limited to using it with a fixed power input. This can still be more
    entertaining than staring at a blind wall during your indoor trainer ride.</p>

    <p>If you have already used this ANT+ stick with other programs, like
    <a href="http://zwift.com/">Zwift</a> or <a href="https://www.trainerroad.com/">Trainerroad</a>
    you already have the right driver installed for this USB ANT+ stick.</p>

    <p>To install the driver, simplly insert the stick into a USB port on your computer. After a few seconds, Windows
    will start to download and install the driver for your device. Wait for this
    to complete before continuing.</p>

    <h2>Installing Real Life Videos</h2>

    <p>Big Ring supports Tacx Real Life Videos. Unfortunately, the newer videos,
        with the extension <tt>.tts</tt> are not supported (yet). Only the older
        ones, with the <tt>.rlv</tt> can be used with Big Ring for the moment.
    <p>If you already have supported Real Life Videos on your computer, you can
        use these. If you don't have any, but want to try out Big Ring, the easiest
        way to get a video is by getting a demo video from Reallifevideo.de. On
        <a href="https://www.reallifevideo.de/rlv.php?rlv=galibier&lang=en">this page</a>
        you can download a 5km demo. Run the installer and choose to install
        Tacx Fortius files. You can simply choose to install in the default path.
        All the files needed to play the video will be placed under
        <tt>C:\Program Files\TacxFortius\catalyst</tt> (on a 32 bit system) or
        <tt>C:\Program Files (x86)\TacxFortius\catalyst</tt> (on 64 bit). You can
        use this path later on when configuring the video path in big ring.
    </p>

    <h2>Running Big Ring</h2>

    <p>You are now ready to run Big Ring Indoor Video Cycling. In the big-ring
        folder, find the file named <tt>big-ring.exe</tt> and double click
        on it.</p>
