    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

    What follows are the instructions for running Big Ring on Windows (Vista/7/8/10).

    <h2 id="download">Download</h2>
    <p>
    Please download the lastest version of Big Ring from the <a href="download.html">Download page</a>.
    </p>

    <h2 id="installing">Installing</h2>

    <p>Big Ring does not have to be installed. Simply extract the files from the zip-file
    you downloaded. Right-click on the zip-file and choose "Extract files". The
    resulting folder will contain all files needed for running Big Ring.</p>

    <h2 id="antusb">ANT+ USB Stick on Windows</h2>

    <p>To use Big Ring with ANT+ sensors, you will need to use an ANT+ USB stick
    (e.g. <a href="http://www.thisisant.com/developer/components/antusb2">this one</a>.).
    If you do not have an ANT+ stick, you can still run the program, but will be
    limited to using it with a fixed power input. This can still be more
    entertaining than staring at a blind wall during your indoor trainer ride.</p>

    <p>If you have already used this ANT+ stick with other programs, like
    <a href="http://zwift.com/">Zwift</a> or <a href="https://www.trainerroad.com/">Trainerroad</a>
    you already have the right driver installed for this USB ANT+ stick.</p>

    <p>To install the driver, simplly insert the stick into a USB port on your computer. After a few seconds, Windows
    will start to download and install the driver for your device. Wait for this
    to complete before continuing.</p>

    <p>When opening
    <code>Control&nbsp;Panel&nbsp;->&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Manager</code>     you
    will see the device listed.</P>

    </p>

    <h2 id="installvideos">Installing Real Life Videos</h2>

    <p>Big Ring supports the following kinds of Real Life Videos.
        <ul>
            <li>Tacx Fortius (<code>.rlv</code> and <code>.pgmf</code> files).</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.cycleops.com/virtualtraining/overview">Cycleops Virtual Training</a> (<code>.xml</code> files).</li>
            <li>GPS Track files (<code>.gpx</code>). This feature is experimental.
        </ul>

        Unfortunately, the newer Tacx videos,  with the extension <code>.tts</code> are not supported (yet). Only the older
        ones, with the <code>.rlv</code> can be used with Big Ring for the moment.
        This is due to the fact that the newer Tacx Trainer Software software uses
        encrypted files.</p>

    <h3>Installing <a href="https://www.cycleops.com/virtualtraining/overview">Cycleops Virtual Training</a></h3>

<p>
    The videos for <a href="https://www.cycleops.com/virtualtraining/overview">Cycleops Virtual Training</a> are normally
    downloaded using the Virtual Training itself. However, the videos from Reallifevideo.de
    also come with Virtual Training Reall Life Video files, so they can be used with Virtual Training, but also
    with Big Ring. To install the Virtual Training files, just use the installer, like
    the one that came with the demo RLV from <a href="https://www.reallifevideo.de/rlv.php?rlv=galibier&lang=en">this page</a>
    and choose to install Virtual Training files.</p>

        <img src="assets/images/install_virtualtraining_files.png" alt="Choose Virtual Training File"
            class="img-responsive" />
     By default, the files will be installed
    into <code>C:\Users\USERNAME\Documents\VirtualTraining\RLV</code> (replacing <code>USERNAME</code> with your own username).
    If you do not use Cycleops Virtual Training, you might as well use another folder, like
    <code>C:\Users\USERNAME\Documents\RealLifeVideo\VirtualTraining</code>
        <img src="assets/images/install_virtualtraining_files2.png" alt="Choose Virtual Training Folder"
            class="img-responsive" />
    Next, just press install and the files will be copied to right folder</p>



    <h3>Installing Tacx Fortius RLV</h3>

    <p>If you already have supported Real Life Videos on your computer, you can
        use these. If you don't have any, but want to try out Big Ring, the easiest
        way to get a video is by getting a demo video from Reallifevideo.de. On
        <a href="https://www.reallifevideo.de/rlv.php?rlv=galibier&lang=en">this page</a>
        you can download a 5km demo. Run the installer and choose to install
        Tacx Fortius files.
        <img src="assets/images/install_fortius_files.png" alt="Choose Tacx Fortius Files"
            class="img-responsive" />

        By default all the files needed to play the video will be placed under
        <code>C:\Program Files\TacxFortius\catalyst</code> (on a 32 bit system) or
        <code>C:\Program Files (x86)\TacxFortius\catalyst</code> (on 64 bit).
        If you don't have any Tacx Software installed, it's perhaps easier to install
        the videos in a custom place, for instance in <code>C:\Users\USERNAME\Documents\RealLifeVideo\TacxFortius</code>,
        replacing <USERNAME> with your own username.
        You can use this path later on when configuring the video path in big ring.

    <h2 id="running">Running Big Ring</h2>

    <p>You are now ready to run Big Ring Indoor Video Cycling. In the big-ring
        folder, find the file named <code>big-ring.exe</code> and double click
        on it.</p>

        The first time you run Big Ring, it will tell you that no video folders
        are configured:
        <img src="assets/images/big-ring-empty.png" alt="Big Ring Without Configuration"
            class="img-responsive" />
        Go to the configuration screen by confirming the dialog and switch to the video <b>Videos</b> tab.
        There you can choose the Video folder using the <b>Change Folder</b> button. When the folder
        has been chosen, for instance <code>C:\Users\USERNAME\Documents\RealLifeVideo</code> Big-Ring
        will import your Real Life Videos.</p>
        <img src="assets/images/configure_video_folder.png" alt="Big Ring Video Folder Configuration"
            class="img-responsive" />

        <p>Next up is the sensor configuration. For now, we'll choose a simple configuration using only
            a fixed power configuration. Later on, if you have ANT+ sensors, you can change it to using
            the power or speed from your sensors. Go to the <b>ANT+&nbsp;Sensors</b> tab and choose
            <b>Create New Configuration</b>. Give your configuration a name, for instance <b>Fixed Power</b>
            and set the power to a value of your liking in the simulation settings, for instance <b>250 Watts</b>.
            Press <b>Save</b> and the configuration is stored.<p>

                <img src="assets/images/fixed_power_configuration.png" alt="Big Ring Fixed Power Configuration"
                    class="img-responsive" />
        <p>On the <b>General</b> tab you can set your weight, which is the your weight including your bike and gear. Also
            you can choose to use metric or imperial units here. The default is metric. Next, close the configuration dialog.</p>


        <p>You are now ready to run Big Ring. After having selected the video from the profiles on the left of your
            screen, press the start button on the lower right.
            <img src="assets/images/big-ring-with-video.png" alt="Big Ring With Video"
                class="img-responsive" />
            Big Ring will now start riding the video. Because a fixed power is chosen, Big Ring will calculate
            the speed at which the video plays by this power and the grade of the road.
        </p>
        <p>
            Have Fun!
