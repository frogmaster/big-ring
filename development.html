<p>Big Ring is programmed in C++ and makes use of the <a href="http://www.qt.io/">Qt Framework.</a>
Apart from Qt the following libraries are used:
<dl>
    <dt><a href="https://libav.org/">libav</a></dt>
    <dd>for video decoding and displaying.</dd>
    <dt><a href="http://wwww.libusb.org">libusb</a></dt>
    <dd>for handling of the usb device. On Ubuntu, installing libusb-1.0-0-dev will install libusb. Version 1.0 is used on Linux. The standard version that is used on Windows
    for ANT+ is libusb-win32, which is based on libusb-0.1. Because of this, internally the API of libusb-0.1 is used.
    On Linux the source of <a href="http://www.libusb.org/wiki/libusb-compat-0.1">libusb-compat</a> is included to make a bridge from the libusb-0.1 API to libusb-1.0.</dd>
