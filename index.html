    <h2>Cycle through amazing scenery, inside</h2>

    <p>Use Big Ring Indoor Video Cycling to make your indoor cycling training more
        interesting by being able to view amazing scenery from your bicycle in your
        pain cave.</p>

    <p>
    <p>Big Ring Indoor Video Cycling can be used in combination with a bicycle,
    indoor cycling trainer and <a href="http://www.thisisant.com">ANT+</a> power, cadence or heart rate sensors.</p>

    <h2 id="reallifevideos">Real Life Videos</h2>

    <p>Real Life Videos are videos of roads or paths which have metadata describing
    the elevation profile and distance of the course. Using this metadata,
    Big Ring can adjust the playing speed of the video to the speed at which
    the cyclist is riding.
    </p>
    <p>Real Life Videos can be bought and/or downloaded from several places:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://cyclingvideo.nl/">cyclingvideo.nl</a></li>

    <h2 id="howdoesitwork">How does it work?</h2>

    <p>To use Big Ring Indoor Cycling, you need a couple of attributes:
        <ul>
            <li>A Bicycle</li>
            <li>An Indoor Bike Trainer, possibly an ANT+ FE-C smart trainer.</li>
            <li>A PC (Windows or Linux)</li>
            <li>One or more <a href="#reallifevideos">Real Life Videos</a></li>
        </ul>

        Using this setup, it's possible to configure a cycling power level (e.g. 250 Watts).
        Big Ring will determine the speed of the cyclist using the grade of the
        road, cyclist's weight, wind resistance and rolling resistance.
    </p>
    <p>
        To make things more interesting, you either need an ANT+ FE-C Smart Trainer, power meter or
        an ANT+ speed sensor. To be able to use these with Big Ring, you will
        also need an ANT+ USB Stick (e.g. <a href="http://www.thisisant.com/developer/components/antusb2">this one</a>).
        If you are using a power meter, Big Ring will again
        determine speed from grade of the
        road, cyclist's weight, wind resistance and rolling resistance, but now
        using the cyclist's real power as input.
    </p>
    <p>
        When using a speed sensor, there are two possibilities. If you have
        trainer with a known power curve (currently only <strong>Cycleops Fluid 2</strong>
        and <strong>Kurt Kinetic Fluid</strong> trainers are supported), you can
        use what is known as <em>Virtual Power</em>. Using Virtual Power, Big Ring
        determines the power output of the cyclist by calculating it using the
        speed of the back wheel. Currently the following trainers are supported:
        <ul>
            <li>Cycleops Fluid 2</li>
            <li>Elite Turbo Muin (2013)</li>
            <li>Kurt Kinetic Fluid (Road Machine and Rock &amp; Roll)</li>
            <li>Kurt Kinetic Cyclone</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have a speed sensor, but no supported trainer, Big Ring can use
        the speed of the back wheel directly. When cycling, you will have to
        adjust the resistance setting of the trainer yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
        You get the best experience when using a Smart Trainer. Then you will really
        feel the slopes your riding up and down. Support for Smart Trainers is
        currently in ALPHA state. No calibration is possible at this moment. It has
        only been tested with an Elite Real Turbo Muin B+. If you have another
        type of Smart Trainer, please test and share the results!
