title: Tacx Vortex Smart support fixed in version 1.7.0
---

Thanks to some help from Tacx tech support and testing by Hakon from Iceland and Claude
from Belgium we managed to fix Tacx Vortex Smart support.

other new features:

* Slope smoothing for GPX uses moving average. Makes for much better gpx profiles. Thanks to 
Vlad from the USA for his suggestions and help.
* Add configuration option for aspect ratio of videos. When videos are not of the same 
aspect ratio (height vs width) as the screen the user you can choose to show black bars or 
cut the edge of the video off.

Bug fix:

* Always show distance markers in profile.
