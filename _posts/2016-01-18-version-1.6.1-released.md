title: Fix for GPS export
---

Changes in the 1.6.1 release

* Fix for jagged GPS tracks in TCX export. GPS tracks are smooth now.

Changes in the 1.6.0 release

* Big Ring will now check if newer versions are available for download
* When riding a Real Life Video with GPS positions positions are saved in the TCX files, so they can be exported to Strava Virtual Rides. Unfortunately, old
 Tacx RLVs (.rlv/.pgmf files) do not contain GPS information.
* ANT+ FE-C: Connection initialization is improved, so the the trainer will be put into simulation mode correctly every time.
* When using imperial units, user and bike weight can be configured in pounds (lbs).
* Make folder where TCX files are saved user configurable.

I've received reports of Tacx Vortex Smart users for whom resistance is not working OK. It would be nice if people with a Tacx Smart trainer would be available to provide feedback about the way their trainer works with Big Ring.
