title: New Year's Fixes
---

Fixes in the 1.5.0 release
 
 * Fixed OpenGL code. A faulty fragment shader was used that worked, but not on newer hardware and
drivers, causing Big Ring to crash. 
 * Restoring window size after a ride should work better. Not perfect yet on Windows unfortunately.

For developers:

 * Changed directory layout of source files. This should make it easier to understand how the build works.
