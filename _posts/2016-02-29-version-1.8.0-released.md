title: Lots of fixes and improvements
---

Most importantly, this version fixes smart trainer disconnection issues that were
occuring sometimes. 

Other new or improved features:

* Support for MP4 video files. In combination with GPX control files, this gives you the opportunity to easily make your own RLVs.
* Added the ability to use multiple video folders.
* Colors for profiles are changed a bit. For very steep grades, the profile turns purple.
* It's now possible to set maximimum uphill and downhill slopes. The simulation (speed calculation) will still use the original slope, but the smart trainer will only set the grades between minimum and maximum. This can help save your knees if you have a powerful trainer like the Tacx Neo, but don't want to have to grind up a 20% slope.
* Using the difficulty setting slider, the trainer will set the grade at a percentage of the original grade. Again, the speed simulation will use the original value.
* Altitude correction: For people living at higher altitudes, it's possible to add a percentage to your power for speed calculations, to compensate for the lower air pressure. The value shown in the interface will still be the original power measured by your sensors. This option gives you the ability to cheat. Use it wisely!

Other bug fixes:

* Improved the stability of the video decoding.
* Video buffer is larger, to make playback smoother when speed is high.
